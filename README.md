# BunnyWars
CSE 3310
This repository contains all the game code for the BunnyWars game. I have finalized and debugged the game, so it is now fully functional. Please download the code to your computer. We will be turning this game into a website, which will require knowledge of html. Majority of the game code can be used.

*NOTICE*

we have to add a time constraint to the code! To keep the website interesting

ASSIGNMENT 1: UML DIAGRAMS due 2/25
General guidelines for what type of UML to pick (always use different types of UML diagrams for
different components based on the nature of the component as described below).

 Use:
 
o Class Diagram: If the component is static, without much going back and forth, i.e., you
just want to show what is in that component.
o State Transition Diagram (STD): If the behavior is dynamic like Login & Registration or
Game playing (i.e., many back & forth actions)
o Activity Diagram: if you just need to show the flow of your process.
o Sequence Diagram: if the order of events is important (e.g., when registering for a class,
order matters, since you must select a class first, then register, then make a payment)

• UML free tool: http://staruml.sourceforge.net/en/

• Make sure all UML diagrams are cohesive (i.e., fonts, colors, formats, are similar, i.e., don’t use
yellow color for one diagram with font 20 and another one with no color and font 10; It is the
job of the Facilitator of the UML increment to make sure the same look & feel is achieved)

• All UML diagrams must have a title in this format: “UML-type-Component Name”, e.g., “UML-
STD-Login& Registration” or “UML-Class-Diagram-System” ...)

• Please ALWAYS place one UML per page (even if they are small and you can put more than one
per page). If UML is too big, it usually means your component is too complicated with too many
details, and it is best if it is broken into two or more smaller UML diagrams.

• Please find various UML samples on the following pages.
